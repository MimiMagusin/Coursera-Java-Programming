# Coursera-Java-Programming
> In this repository, you can find the exercises of this execellent [Coursera course of Duke University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming), and the notes of several things I learnt about Java.

## Week 1: Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics
* Java (_human readable_) **source code** needs to be **compiled** to (_machine readable_) **low level bite code**.
* To write source code, we will use the environment [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/).
* Code is written in **classes**, each class is saved as a _.java_ file and compiled to a _.class_ file.
* To run a method in in BlueJ, compile your class, create a new instance of it (**object**) and call the method you need.
